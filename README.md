# Market-Price-Prediction
ML PROBLEM STATEMENTS | HUBBLEMIND

##Project Description:
The goal of this project is to predict stock prices using linear regression. Interns
will work with a historical dataset that includes various commodity prices,
volumes, and stock prices. This project will help interns understand and apply key
machine learning concepts, including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature
engineering, model development, model evaluation, and prediction system
creation.

##Problem Statements:
Develop a linear regression model to predict Amazon stock prices based on
historical commodity prices and volumes. The project will cover the entire ML
process, from EDA and feature engineering to model development and
evaluation.
