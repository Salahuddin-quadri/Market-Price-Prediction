ML PROBLEM STATEMENTS | HUBBLEMIND


## Problem Statements:
Develop a linear regression model to predict Amazon stock prices based on
historical commodity prices and volumes. The project will cover the entire ML
process, from EDA and feature engineering to model development and
evaluation.

## Introduction
The project aims to predict Amazon stock prices based on historical commodity prices and volumes. This initiative provides interns with a comprehensive understanding of key machine learning concepts, encompassing the entire process from data exploration to model evaluation. By engaging with a real-world dataset, interns will gain practical experience in exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model development, and the creation of a prediction system.

## Challenges
Data Quality: The dataset contained missing values and varied data types that needed to be addressed to ensure accurate modeling.
Feature Relationships: Understanding the relationships between Amazon stock prices and multiple features required in-depth analysis and visualization techniques.
Model Evaluation: Ensuring that the linear regression model was not only accurate but also generalizable to unseen data posed a significant challenge.

## Solutions
To address these challenges, the following solutions were implemented:

 Data Preprocessing: Missing values were filled with the mean of their respective columns, and features were standardized using StandardScaler to ensure uniformity.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Scatter plots and correlation matrices were created to visualize relationships between features and the target variable, enabling informed decisions regarding feature selection.
 Model Development and Validation: An 80-20 split was used to train and test the linear regression model. Evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) were employed to gauge model performance. Additionally.
 
## Roadblocks
Despite the structured approach, some roadblocks were encountered:

Feature Engineering Complexity: Identifying which features significantly impacted the stock price required iterative testing and adjustments to the model.
Overfitting Risks: There was a concern that the model might overfit to the training data, necessitating careful tuning and validation to ensure generalizability.
Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrated the application of linear regression for predicting Amazon stock prices.

## Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrated the application of linear regression for predicting Amazon stock prices. By systematically addressing challenges through data preprocessing, EDA, and robust model evaluation, interns gained valuable insights into the machine learning workflow. The final model not only predicted stock prices effectively but also highlighted the importance of feature selection and evaluation metrics in developing a reliable prediction system. This hands-on experience equips interns with the skills needed to tackle future machine learning challenges in a data-driven environment.
